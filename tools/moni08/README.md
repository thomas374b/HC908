Here you find my own tool to flash via HC908 monitor-mode by applying high voltage to the IRQ pin.
The procedure is described in Freescale Application Note AN2317 (see docs subdirectory)

It makes use of my library libtns_util which is available in my public svn repository
here http://pantzer.eu/svn/tns_util/

There are other monitor-mode flashing utilities freely available on the internet, but I was 
not aware of them when I started this project.
